## General Information
- The loan.csv file contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

- We need to do EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.


## Conclusions

- Borrowers with an annual income <= $50,000 show a higher likelihood of defaulting on their loans
- Debt Consolidation is the most popular loan purpose
